              <h4>
                The Abyssinian is often a colorful cat with a distinctly ticked
                coat, medium in size and regal in appearance; lithe, hard and
                muscular, showing eager activity and lively interest in their
                surroundings. They are often well balanced temperamentally and
                physically.

              <h4>
                The distinctive feature of the American Curl is their
                attractive, uniquely curled-back ears. Elegant, well balanced,
                moderately muscled, slender rather than massive in build. They
                often appear well proportioned and balanced and can vary in
                size.

              <h3>Bengal</h3>
              <h4>
                The Bengal is a domestic cat that has physical features
                distinctive to the small forest-dwelling wildcats, and with the
                loving, dependable temperament of a family pet. As such, some
                characteristics in the appearance of the Bengal are distinct
                from those found in other domestic cat breeds.

              <h3>Chartreux</h3>
              <h4>
                The Chartreux is a sturdy, shorthaired French breed coveted in
                antiquity for its hunting prowess and its dense, water repellent
                fur. This breedâ€™s husky, robust type is sometimes termed
                primitive, neither cobby nor classic. Though amply built,
                Chartreux are extremely supple and agile cats; refined, never
                coarse nor clumsy.

              <h3>Oriental Short Hair</h3>
              <h4>
                The Oriental is a svelte cat with long, tapering lines, very
                lithe but muscular. Excellent physical condition. Eyes clear.
                Strong and lithe, neither bony nor flabby. Because of the longer
                coat, the Longhair Division appears to have softer lines and
                less extreme type than the Shorthair Division.Oriental Short

              <h3>Selkirk Rex</h3>
              <h4>
                The Selkirk Rex is the result of a dominant, spontaneous
                mutation that causes each hair (guard, down and awn) to have a
                gentle curl giving the coat a soft feel. The Selkirk Rex is a
                medium to large cat with heavy boning that gives the cat
                surprising weight and an impression of power.
